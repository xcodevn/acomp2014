      Overseas participants entering Vietnam should possess a passport with valid visa which can be obtained at the Vietnamese Embassies or Consulates in the corresponding countries. Visas are exempted for the citizens of the countries, which have signed a bilateral visa exemption agreement with Vietnam, including Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, and Laos. Vietnam also made a unilateral decision on visa exemption for the Japanese and Korean citizens for short visits within 15 days.
